                        <p>The experience begins with a brief calibration phase, where you answer a few questions about your current life, goals, habits, and challenges. Based on this, your "Future Self" is trained to talk to you like a mentor who knows exactly who you are and what you want — and guides you accordingly.</p>
                        <p><strong>You can:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
